## How to Set Up xinput

To persist your settings even after plugging or unplugging devices, store the configuration files in:

`/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`

Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

Section "InputClass"  
    Identifier "BluetoothMouse3600"  
    MatchProduct "BluetoothMouse3600 Mouse"  
    MatchIsPointer "on"  
    Driver "libinput"  
    Option "AccelSpeed" "-0.5"  
    Option "MiddleEmulation" "on"  
EndSection

Use `xinput list` and `xinput list-props <device-name>` to find the full device name and its available settings.
